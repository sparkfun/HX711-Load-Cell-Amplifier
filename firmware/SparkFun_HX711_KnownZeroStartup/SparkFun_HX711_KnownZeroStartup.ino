 Example using the SparkFun HX711 breakout board with a scale

 Most scales require that there be no weight on the scale during power on. This sketch shows how to pre-load tare values
 so that you don't have to clear the scale between power cycles. This is good if you have something on the scale 
 all the time and need to reset the Arduino and not need to tare the scale.
 
 This example code uses bogde's excellent library: https://github.com/bogde/HX711

 The HX711 does one thing well: read load cells. The breakout board is compatible with any wheat-stone bridge
 based load cell which should allow a user to measure everything from a few grams to tens of tons.

 Arduino pin 2 -> HX711 CLK
 3 -> DOUT
 5V -> VCC
 GND -> GND
 
 The HX711 board can be powered from 2.7V to 5V so the Arduino 5V power should be fine.
