 Example using the SparkFun HX711 breakout board with a scale

 This example demonstrates powering down the breakout board. Our measurements peg the HX711 at 70nA when powered down
 and 15.8mA when powered up. The powered up current depends heavily on the type and number of load cells you
 are using.
 
 This example code uses bogde's excellent library: https://github.com/bogde/HX711

 The HX711 does one thing well: read load cells. The breakout board is compatible with any wheat-stone bridge
 based load cell which should allow a user to measure everything from a few grams to tens of tons.

 Arduino pin 2 -> HX711 CLK
 3 -> DOUT
 5V -> VCC
 GND -> GND
 
 The HX711 board can be powered from 2.7V to 5V so the Arduino 5V power should be fine.
